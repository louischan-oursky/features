# Authgear

## User

A user has many identities. A user has many authenticators.

## Identity

An identity is used to look up a user.

3 types of identity are supported.

- Login ID
- OAuth
- Anonymous

### Identity Claims

The information of an identity are mapped to [Standard Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims)

Currently, only `email` is mapped.

The claims are used to detect duplicate identity. For example, an Email Login ID and the email claim of an OAuth Identity. This prevents duplicate user when the user forgets the original authentication method.

### OAuth Identity

OAuth identity is external identity from supported OAuth 2 IdPs. Only authorization code flow is supported. If the provider supports OIDC, OIDC is preferred over provider-specific OAuth 2 protocol.

#### OIDC IdPs

The following IdPs are integrated with OIDC:

- Google
- Apple
- Azure AD

#### OAuth 2 IdPs

The following IdPs does not support OIDC. The integration is provider-specific.

- LinkedIn
- Facebook

### Anonymous Identity

A user either has no anonymous identity, or have exactly one anonymous identity. A user with anonymous identity is considered as anonymous user.

Anonymous identity has the following fields:

- Public Key: It is represented as a JWK and stored in the database.
- Private Key: It is kept privately and securely in the device storage.
- Key ID: A unique random string for efficient lookup.

From the user point of view, they do not perform any explicit authentication. Therefore

- Anonymous user cannot have secondary authenticators
- Anonymous user cannot access the settings page

#### Anonymous Identity JWT

The server verifies the validity of the key-pair by verify a JWT. A challenge is requested by client on demand, it is one-time use and short-lived. The JWT is provided in the [login_hint](#login-hint)

#### Anonymous Identity JWT headers

- `typ`: Must be the string `vnd.skygear.auth.anonymous-request`.

#### Anonymous Identity JWT payload

- `challenge`: The challenge returned by the server.
- `action`: either `auth` or `promote`

### Anonymous Identity Promotion

Anonymous user can be promoted to normal user by adding a new identity. When an anonymous user is promoted:

- A new non-anonymous identity is added.
- The anonymous identity is deleted.
- A new session is created.

The promotion flow is the same as the normal OIDC authorization code flow.

### Login ID Identity

A login ID has the following attributes:

- Key
- Type
- Normalized value
- Original value
- Unique key

A user can have many login IDs. For example, a user can have both an email and a phone number as their login IDs.

### Login ID Key

Login ID key is symbolic name assigned by the developer.

### Login ID Type

Login ID type determines the validation, normalization and unique key generation rules.

#### Email Login ID

##### Validation of Email Login ID

- [RFC5322](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.4.1)
- Disallow `+` sign in the local part (Configurable, default OFF)

##### Normalization of Email Login ID

- Case fold the domain part
- Case fold the local part (Configurable, default ON)
- Perform NFKC on the local part
- Remove all `.` signs in the local part (Configurable, default OFF)

##### Unique key generation of Email Login ID

- Encode the domain part of normalized value to punycode (IDNA 2008)

#### Username Login ID

##### Validation of Username Login ID

- Disallow confusing homoglyphs
- Validate against PRECIS IdentifierClass profile
- Disallow builtin reserved usernames (Configurable, default ON)
- Disallow developer-provided reserved usernames (Configurable, default empty list)
- Check ASCII Only (`a-zA-Z0-9_-.`) (Configurable, default ON)

##### Normalization of Username Login ID

- Case fold (Configurable, default ON)
- Perform NFKC

##### Unique key generation of Username Login ID

The unique key is the normalized value.

#### Phone Login ID

##### Validation of Phone Login ID

- Check E.164 format

##### Normalization of Phone Login ID

Since well-formed phone login ID is in E.164 format, the normalized value is the original value.

##### Unique key generation of Phone Login ID

The unique key is the normalized value.

#### Raw Login ID

Raw login ID does not any validation or normalization. The unique key is the same as the original value. Most of the use case of login ID should be covered by the above login ID types.

### Optional Login ID Key during authentication

The login ID provided by the user is normalized against the configured set of login ID keys. If exact one identity is found, the user is identified. Otherwise the login ID is ambiguous. Under default configuration, Email, Phone and Username login ID are disjoined sets so no ambiguity will occur. (Email must contain `@`; Username does not contain `@` or `+`; Phone must contain `+` and does not contain `@`)

### The purpose of unique key

If the domain part of a Email login ID is internationalized, there is 2 ways to represent the login ID, either in Unicode or punycode-encoded. To ensure the same logical Email login ID always refer to the same user, unique key is generated.

## Authenticator

Authgear supports various types of authenticator. Authenticator can be primary, secondary or both.

Authenticators has priorities. The first authenticator is the default authenticator in the UI.

### Primary Authenticator

Primary authenticator authenticates the identity. Each identity has specific applicable primary authenticators. For example, OAuth Identity does not have any applicable primary authenticators.

### Secondary Authenticator

Secondary authenticators are additional authentication methods to ensure higher degree of confidence in authenticity.

### Password Authenticator

Password authenticator is a primary authenticator. Every user has at most 1 password authenticator.

### TOTP Authenticator

TOTP authenticator is either primary or secondary.

TOTP authenticator is specified in [RFC6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) and [RFC4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226).

In order to be compatible with existing authenticator applications like Google Authenticator, the following parameters are chosen:

- The algorithm is always HMAC-SHA1.
- The code is always 6-digit long.
- The valid period of a code is always 30 seconds.

To deal with clock skew, the code generated before or after the current time are also accepted.

### OOB-OTP Authenticator

Out-of-band One-time-password authenticator is either primary or secondary.

OOB-OTP authenticator is bound to a verified recipient. The recipient can be a verified email address or a verified phone number that can receive SMS messages.

The OTP is 4-digit long.

### Bearer Token Authenticator

Bearer token authenticator is secondary.

A bearer token is generated during MFA when the user opt to skip MFA next time.

The token is a cryptographically secure random string of 256 bits (32 bytes) in hex encoding.

### Recovery Code Authenticator

Recovery code authenticator is secondary.

Recovery codes are generated when the user adds a secondary authenticator first time.

The codes is cryptographically secure random 10-letter string in Crockford's Base32 alphabet.

## Authentication

- The developer can configure enabled identity types. By default, all supported identity types are enabled.
- The developer can configure enabled primary authenticators. By default, Password Authenticator is enabled.
- The developer can configure enabled secondary authenticators. By default, TOTP, OOB-OTP and Bearer Token Authenticator are enabled.
- The developer can configure whether secondary authentication is necessary.
  - `required`: secondary authentication is required. Every user must have at least one secondary authenticator.
  - `if_exists`: secondary authentication is opt-in. If the user has at least one secondary authenticator, then the user must perform secondary authentication.
  - `if_requested`: secondary authentication is purely optional even the user has at least one secondary authenticator.

## Interaction

Manipulation of user, identities and authenticators are driven by interaction. An interaction starts with an intent and has various steps. When all required steps have been gone through, the interaction is committed to the database.

### Login intent

The login intent authenticate existing user. It involves the following steps:

- Select identity
- Authenticate with primary authenticator
- Authenticate with secondary authenticator / Setup secondary authenticator

For example,

Login with login ID and password

- Select identity by providing a login ID
- Authenticate with password

### Signup intent

The signup intent creates a new user. It involves the following steps:

- Create identity
- Setup primary authenticator
- Setup secondary authenticator

For example,

Login in with Google

- Create identity by perform OIDC authorization code flow with Google
- No primary authenticator is required

### Add Identity intent

The add identity intent adds a new identity to a user. It involves the following steps:

- Create identity
- Setup primary authenticator

For example,

Add Email login ID to a user with 1 OAuth Identity

- The user provides the email address
- Setup OOB-OTP authenticator of the given email address

## OIDC

Authgear acts as OpenID Provider (OP).

### OAuth 2 and OIDC Conformance

Only [Authorization Code Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth) with [PKCE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) is implemented.

### Client Metadata

#### Standard Client Metadata

Supported [standard client metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata) are as follows:

- `redirect_uris`
- `grant_types`
- `response_types`

#### Custom Client Metadata

- `client_id`: OIDC client ID.
- `access_token_lifetime`: Access token lifetime in seconds, default to 1800.
- `refresh_token_lifetime`: Refresh token lifetime in seconds, default to max(access_token_lifetime, 86400). It must be greater than or equal to `access_token_lifetime`.

##### Generic RP Client Metadata example

```yaml
redirect_uris:
- "https://appbackend.com"
grant_types:
- authorization_code
- refresh_token
response_types:
- code
```

Standard configuration for authorization code flow to work properly.

##### Native application Client Metadata example

```yaml
redirect_uris:
- "com.myapp://host/path"
grant_types:
- authorization_code
- refresh_token
response_types:
- code
```

Standard configuration for authorization code flow to work properly. Note that the redirect URI is of custom scheme.

##### Web application sharing the same root domain Client Metadata example

```yaml
redirect_uris:
- "https://www.myapp.com"
grant_types: []
response_types:
- "none"
```

The web application shares the cookies so authorization code is unnecessary.

##### Silent Authentication Client Metadata example

```yaml
redirect_uris:
- "https://client-app-endpoint.com"
grant_types:
- "authorization_code"
response_types:
- "code"
```

Refresh token is not used.

### Authentication Request

#### scope

- `openid`: It is required by the OIDC spec
- `offline_access`: It is required to issue refresh token.

#### response_type

- `code`: Authorization Code Flow
- `none`: [Authgear acting as authentication server with web application](#authgear-acting-as-authentication-server-with-web-application)

#### display

The only supported value is `page`.

#### prompt

The following values are supported.

- `login`
- `none`

#### max_age

Unsupported.

#### id_token_hint

No difference from the spec, for `prompt=none` case.

#### login_hint

Developer can optionally pre-select the identity to use using `login_hint` parameter. `login_hint` should be a URL of form `https://auth.skygear.io/login_hint?<query params>`.

The following are recognized query parameters:
- `type`: Identity type
- `user_id`: User ID
- `email`: Email claim of the user
- `oauth_provider`: OAuth provider ID
- `oauth_sub`: Subject ID of OAuth provider
- `jwt`: JWT object

For examples:
- To login with email `user@example.com`:
    `https://auth.skygear.io/login_hint?type=login_id&email=user%40example.com`
- To login with Google OAuth provider:
    `https://auth.skygear.io/login_hint?oauth_provider=google`
- To signup/login as anonymous user:
    `https://auth.skygear.io/login_hint?type=anonymous&jwt=...`

The UI tries to match an appropriate identity according to the provided parameters. If exactly one identity is matched, the identity is selected. Otherwise `login_hint` is ignored.

Unknown parameters are ignored, and invalid parameters are rejected. However, if user is already logged in and the provided hint is not valid for the current user, it will be ignored instead.

#### acr_values

Unsupported yet.

#### code_challenge_method

Only `S256` is supported. `plain` is not supported.

### Token Request

#### grant_type

- `authentication_code`
- `refresh_token`
- `urn:skygear-auth:params:oauth:grant-type:anonymous-request`

The custom grant type is for authenticating and issuing tokens directly for anonymous user.

#### jwt

Required when the grant type is `urn:skygear-auth:params:oauth:grant-type:anonymous-request`. The value is specified [here](#anonymous-identity-jwt)

### Token Response

#### token_type

It is always the value `bearer`.

#### refresh_token

Present only if authorized scopes contain `offline_access`.

#### scope

It is always absent.

### The metadata endpoint

[OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata)

```
<endpoint>/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

[Authorization Server Metadata](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414#section-2)

```

The following sections list out the supported metadata fields.

#### authorization_endpoint

The value is `<endpoint>/oauth2/authorize`.

#### token_endpoint

The value is `<endpoint>/oauth2/token`.

#### userinfo_endpoint

The value is `<endpoint>/oauth2/userinfo`.

#### revocation_endpoint

The value is `<endpoint>/oauth2/revoke`.

#### jwks_uri

The value is `<endpoint>/oauth2/jwks`.

#### scopes_supported

See [scope](#scope)

#### response_types_supported

The value is `["RS256"]`.

#### claims_supported

The value is `["sub", "iss", "aud", "exp", "iat"]`.

#### code_challenge_methods_supported

The value is `["S256"]`

### ID Token

### amr

To indicate authenticator used in authentication, `amr` claim is used in OIDC ID token.

`amr` claim is an array of string. It includes authentication method used:
- If secondary authentication is performed: `mfa` is included.
- If password authenticator is used: `pwd` is included.
- If any OTP (TOTP/OOB-OTP) is used: `otp` is included.
- If WebAuthn is used: `hwk` is included.

If no authentication method is to be included in `amr` claim, `amr` claim would be omitted from the ID token.

### acr

If any secondary authenticator is performed, `acr` claim would be included in ID token with value `http://schemas.openid.net/pape/policies/2007/06/multi-factor`.

To perform step-up authentication, developer can pass a `acr_values` of  `http://schemas.openid.net/pape/policies/2007/06/multi-factor` to the authorize endpoint.

1. SDK sends authorization request with response_type=none + client id
1. Authgear redirects user to authorization page
1. User authorizes and consents
1. Authgear creates IdP session in eTLD+1, redirect empty result back to client SDK
1. Since IdP session is set in eTLD+1, cookies header will be included when user send request to AppBackend too. The reverse proxy delegates to Authgear to resolve the session.

### Silent Authentication

Silent authentication is alternative way to refresh access token without a refresh token. It is achieved with `prompt=none&id_token_hint=...`. In web environment, local storage is not a secure place to store refresh token.

Since [Cookie sharing approach](#authgear-acting-as-authentication-server-with-web-application) covers all basic use cases, this is not yet implemented.

#### Comparison with cookie sharing approach

[Cookie sharing approach](#authgear-acting-as-authentication-server-with-web-application)

- Pros:
  - Cookie is used so Server Side Rendering (SSR) app and Single Page App (SPA) are both supported.
- Cons:
  - Not fully OIDC compliant. The IdP session is used directly.
  - App must be first party app. That is they are sharing the eTLD+1 domain.

Silent Authentication

- Pros:
  - OIDC compliant
  - App does not need to be first party app.
- Cons:
  - Only SPA is supported.

1. Authgear returns token response to SDK with id token + new access token

## Templates

Authgear serves web pages and send email and SMS messages. Templates allow the developer to provide localization or even customize the default ones.

### Template

Each template must have a type, optionally a key and a language tag.

#### Template Type

Each template must have a type. The list of types are predefined. Here are some examples

```
forgot_password_email.html
forgot_password_email.txt

user_verification_message.html
user_verification_message.txt
```

#### Template Key

Some template may require a key. The key is used differentiate different instances of the same type of the template. For example, the verification message template of email message should be different from that of SMS message.

#### Template Language Tag

Each template may optionally have a language tag. The language tag is specified in [BCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47).

### Template Resolution

To resolve a template, the input is the template type, optionally the template key and finally the user preferred languages. The type and key is determined by the feature while the user preferred languages is provided by the user.

All templates have default value so template resolution always succeed.

The templates are first resolved by matching the type and the key. And then select the best language according to the user preferred languages.

### Component Templates

Some template may depend on other templates which are included during rendering. This enables customizing a particular component of a template. The dependency is expressed by a whitelist that is hard-coded by the Skygear developer. It can be assumed there is no dependency cycle.

For example, `auth_ui_login.html` depend on `auth_ui_header.html` and `auth_ui_footer.html` to provide the header and footer. If the developer just wants to customize the header, they do not need to provide customized templates for ALL pages. They just need to provide `auth_ui_header.html`.

### Localization of the text of the template

In addition to the template language tag, sometimes it is preferred to localize the text of the template rather the whole template.

For example, `auth_ui_login.html` defines the HTML structure and is used for all languages. What the developer wants to localize is the text.

### localize

A special function named `localize` can be used to format a localized string.

```html
<input type="password" placeholder="{{ localize "enter.password" }}">
<!-- <input type="password placeholder="Enter Password"> -->
```

```html
<p>{{ localize "email.sent" .email .name }}</p>
<!-- <p>Hi John, an email has been sent to john.doe@example.com</p -->
```

`localize` takes a translation key, followed any arguments required by that translation key. If the key is not found, the key itself is returned.

### Translation file

The translation file is a template itself. It is simply a flat JSON object with string keys and string values. The value is in ICU MessageFormat. Not all ICU MessageFormat arguments are supported. The supported are `select`, `plural` and `selectordinal`.

Here is an example of the translation file.

```json
{
  "email.sent": "Hi {1}, an email has been sent to {0}"
}
```

#### Translation Resolution

Translation resolution is different from template resolution. Template resolution is file-based while translation resolution is key-based.

For example,

```json
// The zh variant of auth_ui_translation.json
{
  "enter.password": "輸入密碼",
  "enter.email": "輸入電郵地址"
}
```

```json
// The zh-Hant-HK variant of auth_ui_translation.json
{
  "enter.password": "入你嘅密碼"
}
```

And the user preferred languages is `["zh-Hant-HK"]`.

`"enter.password"` resolves to `"入你嘅密碼"` and `"enter.email"` resolves to `"輸入電郵地址"`.

## The resolve endpoint

Popular reverse proxy server supports delegating request authentication by initiating subrequest.

In nginx, it is the `auth_request` directive while in Traefik, it is `ForwardAuth`.

The resolve endpoint `/resolve` looks at `Cookie:` and `Authentication:` to authenticate the request. `Cookie:` has higher precedence.

The resolve endpoint does not write body. Instead it adds the following headers in the response.

### x-skygear-session-valid

Tell whether the session of the original request is valid.

If this header is absent, it means the original request is not associated with any session.

If the value is `true`, it indicates the original request has valid session. More headers will be included.

If the value is `false`, it indicates the original request has invalid session.

### x-skygear-user-id

The user id.

### x-skygear-user-anonymous

The value `true` means the user is anonymous. Otherwise it is a normal user.

### x-skygear-session-acr

See [the acr claim](#acr).

### x-skygear-session-amr

See [the amr claim](#amr). It is comma-separated.

## UI

The UI creates new users and authenticates existing ones. The user can manage their account in the settings page.

### Theming

The developer can provide a CSS stylesheet to customize the theme of the UI. Or they override the templates with their own ones.

### The phone input widget

The developer can customize the list of country calling code and the default country calling code of the phone input widget via configuration. By default the list includes all country calling codes globally. The default value is the first one in the list.

### frame-ancestors

The `frame-ancestors` directive of the HTTP header `Content-Security-Policy:` is derived from the `redirect_uris` of all clients. If the `redirect_uri` is of scheme `https`, the host is added to to frame-ancestors. If the `redirect_uri` is `http` and the host is loopback address or the domain ends with `.localhost`, the host is also added to frame-ancestors.

### The login page

The login page authenticates the user. It lists out the configured IdPs. It shows a text field for login ID. The login ID field is either a plain text input or a phone number input, depending on the type of the first login ID key. Link to the forgot password page is shown if Password Authenticator is enabled.

```
|---------------------------|
| Login with Google         |
|---------------------------|
| Login with Facebook       |
|---------------------------|

              Or

|--------------------------------------|  |----------|
| Enter in your email or username here |  | Continue |
|--------------------------------------|  |----------|

Login with a phone number instead.
Forgot password?
```

### The enter password page

The enter password page displays a visibility toggleable password field.

```
|-----------------------|  |----------|
| Enter a password here |  | Continue |
|-----------------------|  |----------|
```

### The signup page

The signup page creates new user. It looks like the login page. It displays the first login ID key by default. Other login ID keys are available to choose from.

```
Sign up with email
|--------------------------|  |----------|
| Enter in your email here |  | Continue |
|--------------------------|  |----------|

Sign up with phone instead.
Sign up with username instead.
```

### The create password page

The create password page displays a visibility toggleable password field with password requirements.

```
|------------------------|  |----------|
| Create a password here |  | Continue |
|------------------------|  |----------|

- [ ] At least one digit
- [ ] At least one uppercase English character
- [ ] At least one lowercase English character
- [ ] At least one symbols ~`!@#$%^&*()-_=+[{]}\|;:'",<.>/?
- [ ] At least 8 characters long
```

### The forgot password page

The forgot password page displays an email text field. When the user enter a valid Email Login ID, a reset password link to sent to that email address.

### The reset password page

The reset password page looks like the create password page.

### The OOB OTP page

The OOB OTP page lets the user to input OOB OTP. A resend button with cooldown is shown as well.

### The identity page

The identity page lists out the candidates of identity and the status.

```
|---------------------------------------|
| Google                        Connect |
|---------------------------------------|
| Email                                 |
| user@example.com               Change |
|---------------------------------------|
| Phone                             Add |
|---------------------------------------|
```

## Session Management

Sessions in Authgear are stateful. The user can manage sessions. The developer can configure session characteristics such as lifetime and idle timeout.

### Session Attributes

Session has the following attributes:

- ID
- User ID
- AMR
- ACR
- Creation Time
- Last Access Time
- Creation IP
- Last Access IP
- User Agent

In particular, session does not have reference to involved identity and authenticators in the authentication. Removal of identity and authenticators does not invalidate session.

### Session Management

The user manages their sessions in the settings page. They can list the sessions and revoke them.

TODO(session): support session name. Default session name should be device name.

### Session token

Session token must be treated as opaque string.

### Session Types

#### IdP Session

When the user authenticates successfully, an IdP session is created.

Idp session has configurable lifetime. IdP session may optionally have idle timeout. The session must be accessed before the timeout or the session is expired.

IdP session token is stored in the user agent cookie storage. The cookie domain attribute is configurable. The default value is eTLD + 1. As long as the web application is under the same domain with Authgear, the IdP session is shared across between the two. The cookie is a persistent cookie by default. The cookie is http-only and is not configurable. The cookie is SameSite=lax and is not configurable. The cookie is secure by default.

The IdP session configuration is global.

#### Offline Grant

Each OAuth client has its own configuration of offline grant.

Offline grant consists of a refresh token and an access token. As long as the refresh token remains valid, access tokens can be refreshed with the refresh token independent of the IdP session. Offline grant is intended for use in native application.

Access token has configurable lifetime.

Refresh token has configurable lifetime. It cannot be refreshed. The old access token is invalidated during refresh. At any time there is at most one valid access token.

The lifetime of offline grant is the lifetime of its refresh token.

## Webhook

Webhook is the mechanism to notify external services about events.

### Webhook Events

Webhook events are triggered when some mutating operation is performed.

Each operation will trigger two events: BEFORE and AFTER.

- BEFORE event is triggered before the operation is performed. The operation can be aborted by webhook handler.
- AFTER event is triggered after the operation is performed.

Additionally, a `user_sync` event is triggered along with the main event.

BEFORE and AFTER events have the same payload.

## Webhook Delivery

The webhook event is POSTed to the webhook handler endpoint.

The webhook handler endpoint must be an absolute URL.

Each event can have many handlers. The order of delivery is unspecified for AFTER event. BEFORE events are delivered in the source order as in the configuration.

BEFORE events are always delivered before AFTER events.

Webhook handler should be idempotent, since AFTER events may be delivered multiple times due to retries.

Webhook handler must return a status code within the 2xx range. Other status code is considered as a failed delivery.

### Webhook Event Lifecycle

1. Begin transaction
1. Perform operation
1. Deliver BEFORE events to webhook handlers
1. If failed, rollback the transaction.
1. If mutation requested, perform mutation.
1. Commit transaction
1. Deliver AFTER events to webhook handlers

### Webhook BEFORE Events

BEFORE events are delivered to webhook handlers synchronously, right before committing changes to the database.

Webhook handler must respond with a JSON body to indicate whether the operation should continue.

To let the operation to proceed, respond with `is_allowed` being set to `true`.

```json
{
  "is_allowed": true
}
```

To fail the operation, respond with `is_allowed` being set to `false` and a non-empty `reason`. Additional information can be included in `data`.

```json
{
  "is_allowed": false,
  "reason": "any string",
  "data": {
    "foobar": 42
  }
}
```

If any handler fails the operation, the operation is failed. The operation fails with error

```json
{
  "error": {
    "name": "Forbidden",
    "reason": "WebHookDisallowed",
    "info": {
      "reasons": [
        {
          "reason": "any string",
          "data": {
            "foobar": 42
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

BEFORE events webhook handlers can request mutations, see [Webhook Mutations](#webhook-mutations) for details.

The time spent in a BEFORE event delivery must not exceed 5 seconds, otherwise it would be considered as a failed delivery. Also, the total time spent in all deliveries of the event must not exceed 10 seconds, otherwise it would also be considered as a failed delivery. Both timeouts are configurable.

BEFORE events are not persisted and their failed deliveries are not retried.

A failed operation does not trigger AFTER events.

### Webhook AFTER Events

AFTER events are delivered to webhook handlers asynchronously after the operation is performed (i.e. committed into the database).

The time spent in an AFTER event delivery must not exceed 60 seconds, otherwise it would be considered as a failed delivery.

All AFTER events with registered webhook handlers are persisted into the database, with minimum retention period of 30 days.

The response body of AFTER event webhook handler is ignored.

If any delivery failed, all deliveries will be retried after some time, regardless of whether some deliveries may have succeeded. The retry is performed with a variant of exponential back-off algorithm. If `Retry-After:` HTTP header is present in the response, the delivery will not be retried before the specific time.

If the delivery keeps on failing after 3 days from the time of first attempted delivery, the event will be marked as permanently failed and will not be retried automatically.

### Webhook Mutations

BEFORE event webhook handler can request mutation on some fields before committing to the database.

Webhook handler cannot request mutation if the operation is failed by the handler.

Webhook handler request mutation in its response. For example,

```json
{
  "is_allowed": true,
  "mutations": {
    "metadata": {
      "foobar": 42
    }
  }
}
```

- If a field is absent, no mutation would be performed for that field.
- If a field is present, the field would be set to the provided value.

The following fields can be mutated:

- `metadata`

If mutations failed, the operation will be failed.
If the operation failed, the mutations are rolled back and have no effects.

Mutations do not generate additional events.

The mutated values are propagated along the handler chain.

The developer is responsible for correctly ordering the webhook handlers. For example, in most cases, the developer should order mutating handlers (e.g. populating default values) before non-mutating handlers (e.g. validating field values).

### Webhook Event List

#### before_user_create, after_user_create

When a new user is being created.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "user": { ... },
    "identities": [ { ... } ]
  }
}
```

#### before_identity_create, after_identity_create

When a new identity is being created for an existing user. So it does not trigger together with `before_user_create` and `after_user_create`.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "user": { ... },
    "identity": { ... }
  }
}
```

#### before_identity_update, after_identity_update

When an identity is being updated.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "user": { ... },
    "old_identity": { ... },
    "new_identity": { ... }
  }
}
```

#### before_identity_delete, after_identity_delete

When an identity is being deleted from an existing user.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "user": { ... },
    "identity": { ... }
  }
}
```

#### before_session_create, after_session_create

When a session is being created for a new user or an existing user.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "reason": "signup",
    "user": { ... },
    "identity": { ... },
    "session": { ... }
  }
}
```

- `reason`: The reason for the creation of the session, can be `signup` or `login`.

#### before_session_delete, after_session_delete

When a session is being deleted from an existing user, e.g. logging out.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "reason": "logout",
    "user": { ... },
    "session": { ... }
  }
}
```

- `reason`: The reason for the deletion of the session, can be `logout`.

#### before_user_update, after_user_update

When any user attributes are being updated for an existing user.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "reason": "administrative",
    "metadata": { ... },
    "user": { ... }
  }
}
```

- `reason`: The reason for the update, can be `update_metadata` and `administrative`.
- `metadata`: The new metadata. Absent if not changed.
- `user`: The snapshot of the user before the operation.

#### before_password_update, after_password_update

When the password is being updated for an existing user.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "reason": "reset_password",
    "user": { ... }
  }
}
```

- `reason`: The reason for the update, can be `change_password`, `reset_password` and `administrative`.
- `user`: The snapshot of the user before the operation.

#### user_sync

`user_sync` is a special event. It is delivered like an AFTER event.

When an operation could potentially mutate some data (including user, identities and authenticators), this event is generated, regardless of whether mutation actual takes place.

This event can be used to synchronize data to user-managed database.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "user": { ... }
  }
}
```

- `user`: The user after operation.

**NOTE**
- The event would be generated unconditionally whenever a mutating operation is
  used; for example, disabling an already disabled user would still generate
  this event.
- If this event is generated by a session creation API, the `last_login_at`
  field of user object would be the time this session is created, unlike
  `session_create` events.

### Webhook Event Management

### Webhook Event Alerts

If an event delivery is permanently failed, an ERROR log is generated to notify developers.

### Webhook Past Events

An API is provided to list past events. This can be used to reconcile self-managed database with the failed events.

> NOTE: BEFORE events are not persisted, regardless of success or failure.

### Webhook Manual Re-delivery

The developer can manually trigger a re-delivery of failed event, bypassing the retry interval limit.

> NOTE: BEFORE events cannot be re-delivered.

### Webhook Delivery Security

#### Webhook HTTPS

Webhook handlers must be HTTPS. This ensures integrity and confidentiality of the delivery.

#### Webhook Signature

Each webhook event request is signed with a secret key shared between Authgear and the webhook handler. The developer must validate the signature and reject requests with invalid signature to ensure the request originates from Authgear.

The signature is calculated as the hex encoded value of HMAC-SHA256 of the request body.

The signature is included in the header `x-skygear-body-signature:`.

> For advanced end-to-end security scenario, some network admin may wish to
> use mTLS for authentication. It is not supported at the moment.

### Webhook Considerations

#### Recursive Webhooks

A ill-designed web-hook handler may be called recursively. For example, updating user metadata when handling `after_user_update` event.

The developer is responsible for ensuring that:
- webhook handlers would not be called recursively; or
- recursive web-hook handlers have well-defined termination condition.

#### Webhook Delivery Reliability

The main purpose of webhook is to allow external services to observe state changes.

Therefore, AFTER events are persistent, immutable, and delivered reliably. Otherwise, external services may observe inconsistent changes.

It is not recommended to perform side-effect in BEFORE event handlers. Otherwise, the developer should consider how to compensate for the side-effect of potential failed operation.

#### Webhook Eventual Consistency

Fundamentally, webhook is a distributed system. When webhook handlers have side-effects, we need to choose between guaranteeing consistency or availability of the system (See [CAP Theorem](#cap-theorem)).

We decided to ensure the availability of the system. To maintain consistency, the developer should take eventual consistency into account when designing their system.

The developer should regularly check the past events for unprocessed events to ensure consistency.

#### Webhook Event Timing

There are four theoretically delivery timing of events: sync BEFORE, async BEFORE, sync AFTER and async AFTER.

Async BEFORE is mostly useless. The oepration may not be successful and the handler cannot affect the operation. So async BEFORE events do not exist.

Sync AFTER cannot be used safely due to the following reasoning:

- If it is not within the operation transaction, async AFTER can be used instead.
- If it is within the operation transaction and has no side-effects, sync BEFORE can be used instead.
- If it is within the operation transaction and has side-effects, async AFTER should be used instead.

So sync AFTER events do not exists.

#### CAP Theorem

To simplify, the CAP theorem state that, a distributed data store can satify
only two of the three properties simultaneously:
- Consistency
- Availability
- Network Partition Tolerance

Since network partition cannot be avoided practically, distributed system would
need to choose between consistency and availabilty. Most microservice
architecture prefer availabilty over strong consistency, and instead application
state is eventually consistent.

#### Webhook Event Shape

All webhook events have the following shape:

```json
{
  "id": "0E1E9537-DF4F-4AF6-8B48-3DB4574D4F24",
  "seq": 435,
  "type": "after_user_create",
  "payload": { ... },
  "context": { ... }
}
```

- `id`: The ID of the event.
- `seq`: A monotonically increasing signed 64-bit integer.
- `type`: The type of the webhook event.
- `payload`: The payload of the webhook event, varies with type.
- `context`: The context of the webhook event.

##### Webhook Event Shape Versioning

All fields are guaranteed that only backward-compatible changes would be made.

- Existing fields would not be removed or changed in meaning.
- New fields may be added.

##### Webhook Event Context

- `timestamp`: signed 64-bit UNIX timestamp of when this event is generated. Retried deliveries do not affect this field.
- `user_id`: The ID of the user associated with the event. It may be absent. For example, the user has not authenticated yet.

## Configuration Conventions

This section outlines the configuration conventions Authgear must follow.

### Prefer list over map

Instead of

```yaml
login_id_keys:
  email:
    type: email
  phone:
    type: phone
  username:
    type: username
```

Do this

```yaml
login_id_keys:
- key: email
  type: email
- key: phone
  type: phone
- key: username
  type: username
```

### Introduce flag only if necessary

Add `enabled` or `disabled` flag only if necessary, such as toggling on/off of a feature.
